# Scission: A Tool for Maximising Performance of Deep Neural Networks in Edge Computing 

## About the research
Scission is a tool for automated benchmarking of distributed DNNs on a given set of target device, edge and cloud resources for identifying the execution approach and determining the optimal partition for maximising the performance of DNN inference. In doing so, it addresses the following questions:

1. Which combination of potential target hardware resources maximises performance?
2. Which sequence of layers should be distributed across the target resource(s) for maximising DNN performance?
3. How can the performance of DNNs be optimised given user-defined objectives or constraints?

Scission is underpinned by a six-step benchmarking approach (as shown below) that collects benchmark data by executing the DNNs on all target resources and subsequently identifies whether a native or distributed execution approach is most suited for the DNN.

For distributed execution, it identifies the optimal resource pipeline and partitions measured by the lowest end-to-end latency (compute time on resources and the communication time between resources) of the DNN by: (i) pairing the most computationally intensive layers with capable resources to minimize compute latencies, and at the same time (ii) selecting layers with the least amount of output data as potential end layers of a partition to minimise communication latencies. Thus the decision-making approach in Scission is context-aware by capitalising on the hardware capabilities of the target resources, their locality, the characteristics of DNN layers, and network condition. Scission relies on empirical data and does not estimate performance by making assumptions of the target hardware.

## About the software

### Viewing Help
```python3 ./scission_benchmark.py --help```  
```python3 ./scission_predict.py --help```

### Scission benchmarking

#### Dependencies
* Tensorflow 2.1
* NumPy
* Pillow

#### Benchmarking

```python3 ./scission_benchmark.py cloud 6700k cat.jpeg```

An output file "cloud-6700k(GPU).dat" will be saved which contains the benchmark data for each benchmarked model.

### Scission prediction

#### Dependencies
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

#### Network Statistics 

Predictions use externally provided network statistics in a csv file formatted as below:

```
source,     destination,     ping(ms),      bandwidth(mbps)
device,     edge,            66.7,          1.6
device,     cloud,           100,           1.6
edge,       cloud,           20,            50
```

#### Querying - Criteria Format

* A number to indicate that the layer with the corresponding number must be executed on that platform.
* A number preceded by a "!" to indicate that the layer with corresponding number must not be executed on that platform.
* A string to indicate that only the system with the specified name is used for that platform.
* A string predceded by a "!" to indicate that the specified system must not be used. 

Criteria | Explanation 
-------- | ---------- 
-d “3,!10,device1” | Layer 3 must be executed on device, layer 10 must not. The device with name "device1" must be used.
-e “-1” | The edge must not be used.
-c “30,!cloud1” | Layer 30 must be executed on the cloud, the device with name “cloud1” must not be used.

#### Prediction

```python3 ./scission_predict.py benchmark_data network_stats.csv vgg19 -d "!-1" -e 10 -c 16```

The specified benchmark_data folder must contain data files produced by "scission_benchmark" and a network statistics file which contains network connection information for each of the systems benchmarked. An example folder containing benchmark files and network statistic files has been provided ("benchmark_data").

The fastest configurations that fit the specified criteria will be printed, additionally a graph of the fastest configuration showing per layer latencies and network overheads will be saved to the working directory.

The configurations are printed in the format: 
```
End-to-End latency - Total bandwidth used across the edge pipeline - Layer distribution
```

The output from the above prediction is displayed below:
